Well, my name is Alperen Ert√ºrk.
I'm a Web Developer who is improving himself on the front-End.

I always try to find a new and better way to code, always checking my code for "is it a better and faster way to do it".

It's been 6 years since I started Front-End coding, and since then the only thing I've done is try to find new challenges and learn how to solve them.

My specialty is converting any kind of design of a website to a responsive, cross-browser, and cross-device version.

I'm at master's level on:
HTML,
CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS,
JS (JQuery),

Also, I can use any library and write down those languages.

My personal life is always full of responsibility and requirements, which I don't possess at the moment, but I always conquer my problems with my problem-solving abilities, much like coding.

Im also teaching my skill to my love and my new apprentice. In a way, teaching is the best way to master a skill, am I right?

Im looking for new job opportunities because, no matter how much I improve myself, my job environment is getting behind me and slowing me down.
